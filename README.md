# Java-miniprojects-primarily-algorithms-and-datastructures
This is going to be a decently lengthy repository of datastructures, algorithms and whatever else I want to randomly implement in Java. 

There are no "major big projects" located here, primarily these files are just random Java files that I created when I was curious about how to implement something, this is by no means meant as awe-inspiring. But I found the time taken to create these extremely useful and helpful in my understanding of the Java language. 


##Major sections (EXTREMELY likely to grow with time):

####Sorts and searches. 

Staple sorts and searches category, includes the basics.

####DFs, BFS, Adjacency Lists and Adjacency Matrices... essentially a whole lot of graph algorithm related material.

Exactly as the (very long winded) title said. 



##### Please note: Most of these functions are not implemented in full out OO style, and often come with main functions attached. This is primarily meant to make testing and playing around with the algorithms extremely straight forward.
